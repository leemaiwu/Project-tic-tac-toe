# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe web app!

![Tic Tac Toe Game](https://github.com/leemaiwu/Project-tic-tac-toe/blob/main/ReadMe_img/tic-tac-toe-home.png?raw=true)

The app allows 2 users to play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other on a 3x3 board.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Play it yourself!

Clone or download the project.
Navigate to the directory containing the code and run the following terminal commands

`npm install`

`npm start`

## Features

- There are two players, 'X' and 'O'.
- The game will determine a winner when a player gets three squares in a row (in any direction).
- If the game ends in a tie, you'll receive a message letting you know.
- Click the Reset button anytime to reset the game and wipe the board.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the app, try the following:

- Make sure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Ensure that all dependencies are installed by running `npm install`.
- If the app fails to start, check the console for any error messages.
- If you're still having issues, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository.
